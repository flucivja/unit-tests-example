# Unit testing (coupled vs decoupled unit tests)

This repo is related to my [blog post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YuY6n28wgSaQnWrrj6njJmPBnbA6lalh1TJgbQzfY5E/edit?usp=sharing) where I explain differences.

Repository contains simple Todos application 
which purpose is to show difference in unit testing approach.

This repository contains 3 branches:
- main - main branch with all tests
- coupled-tests - tests which are coupled to production code
- decoupled-tests - tests which are decoupled from production code
