# Unit testing (coupled vs decoupled unit tests)

This repo is related to my [blog post](https://dev.to/flucivja/give-your-code-coverage-sense-or-how-to-write-unit-tests-for-what-matters-43c3) where I explain differences.

Repository contains simple Todos application 
which purpose is to show difference in unit testing approach.

This repository contains 3 branches:
- main - main branch with all tests
- coupled-tests - tests which are coupled to production code
- decoupled-tests - tests which are decoupled from production code
